    outOfPocket: "Yes you can. It's an option just not usually a recommended one. Keep a few things in mind. One, repair costs can be expensive and the shop can't always see all the damage before they start work; both of which take a lot of people by surprise. A shop can only include damage they can see prior to actually pulling pieces off your car to start working and sometimes there's damage underneath that they'd have to add to the estimate as what's called a supplement. This isn't necessarily the shop trying to put one over on you it's just a reality of fixing a car after an impact. Insurance companies know this so when it happens they make sure it's legitimate, but don't generally have a problem with it. People settling out of pocket aren't always expecting it and someone who thought repair costs would be lower may have seconds thoughts when they realize it's going to cost more than they thought or can afford. Two, consider rental. Are you going to need one? Do you have another car you can use while yours is in the shop? People agreeing to settle out of pocket don't always realize that if the accident is their fault they owe you transportation cost (how much depends on your state's insurance guidelines), if you need one, for the reasonable repair time of your car. So as far as settling out of pocket and outside insurance it's your decision, but a smart move would be to only do it if the at fault person understands and is ok with the initial repair estiamte, the possibility of a supplement, is willing to cover the cost of a rental or you just don't need one, and you're ok with risking trusting their answers to these questions. And it's a decision you should make BEFORE money changes hands because after that point it becomes much more difficult for the insurance companies to get involved.",

    filingOptions: "Whenever you're in an accident, and the other person is at fault, you essentially have two options. They both have both pro's and cons. One option is to file through the at fault person's insurance. The pro there is that, ONCE and IF they've accepted responsibility/liability, that insurance company will cover your damages without worrying about whatever's on your own policy. Specifically you won't have to pay your deductible and, whether or not you have rental coverage on your own policy, the other party should be able to cover a rental for the reasonable repair time of your car. The con is that it's only ONCE and IF they've accepted liability. This could take time for a number of reasons, some of which are not in your or the insurance company's control, and if liability ends up being disputed then it may ultimately not be an option at all. The other option is to file through your own insurance company. The pro there is that they can start your repairs right away. The con is that it's based on your policy. This means that you'll probably pay your deductible, at the very unill and if the insurance company can get it back, and whether or not your insurance company will cover a rental will depend on whether or not you put that coverage on your policy prior to the accident. When deciding who to file through the smartest thing is to look at those pro's and con's and make the best choice for your situation. If your car isn't drivable, and especially if it's sitting in a storage yard somewhere or you're accruing increased costs the longer it isn't repaired, the best option may be to file through your own insurance. If your car's drivable or you have another way to get around and you won't be accruing additional costs then it wouldn't necessarily hurt to wait it out and see if the other side accepts liability.",

    insuranceRaise: "Not necessarily. An insurance hike is always a possibility. Rates go up and down for all kinds of reasons and your accident isn't the only factor. Keep this in mind though. Assuming your accident isn't your fault, and more importantly your insurance company can have that decision upheld, then once your damages are paid, money is going to change hands based on who was at fault. If you filed through the at-fault insurance company this doesn't mean much because the right people already paid for the claim. If you filed through your insurance company then they're going to send what's called a 'subrogation demand' to the at fault insurance. Basically they'll bill them and should recover what they paid (and if that includes your deductible they'll reimburse it to you). Assuming that happens then you're left with a not-at-fault accident on record and no money, ultimately, lost for covering your damages. If that happens then it's entirely possible your rates won't go up just because you filed through your insurance. The insurance company doesn't want to eat the cost of your damages any more than you do your deductible so if they can recover that money they will. If they can't, because liability was ultimately, succesefully disputed then filing through the other insurance company was probably never going to be an option anyway.",

    shopChoice: "No matter what state you live in you can ALWAYS pick your own shop. The insurance company covering your damages will owe for the reasonable repair cost to repair your vehicle regardless of where you choose to repair. The insurance company will probably offer to recommend some shops in their network and it's generally the better option for this reason; the insurance company can step in if there's a problem with repairs. Insurance companies keep networks of shops so that they have contracts and pull with those shops. If the shop screws up the repair or their work isn't up to par the insurance company can step in and hold them to the contract. They've also usually put some work into streamlining the process there so a screw up is less likely and if does happen they can do something about it. If you use an out of network shop and there's an issue then it's between you and the shop because the insurance company has no control over them. So if you're nervous get a few network shop names, check out their reviews, even go down to the shop and check it out if you'd like. To be clear your shop of choice may do a fine job, but the difference is that if they don't then you're on your own. The insurance company wants your repair to go smoothly because if it doesn't then you're going to tell them about it, and then they'll have to hear about it and, if they even can, spend time and effort trying to fix it. Choosing a network shop makes that much less likely so it's a win win.",

    oemParts: "No, with very few exceptions (most determined by the state department of insurance) OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer or basically brand new parts made by the company that makes your vehicle) are not owed if something has to be replaced on your car. The reasoning is this. The purpose of insurance is to restore you financially to where you were IMMEDIATELY PRIOR to the loss. Your car is insured for what it was worth immediately prior to the accident. This is why it's cheaper to insure an old, cheap car than a new, expensive car because the risk or potential payout is less. Replacing your used part with a brand new one wouldn't be restoring your car it would be improving it. For this reason what the vast majority of states and state departments of insurance have decided is a fair replacement is either a used/salvaged part or a brand new aftermarket part. Many insurance companies require that their part suppliers warranty the parts so IF there is a real issue with the part they'll cover to fix it or find one that works. If it's really that important to you then you can always pay the difference between the covered part and the OEM one but the insurance company is almost certainly not going to cover OEM because it would be making the car better than it was before the accident and it's not legally owed."
